# PacMan Exercise
## Description
In this assignment the task was to update a simulation of a PacMan to move across the screen automatically and reverse when reaching the edge of the browser window. This was done by 1. Updating checkPageBounds function to reverse direction and 2. Adding a setInterval to run every 200ms. The assignment allowed to familiarize how to control the Document Object Model(DOM) through modifying some Javascript. A total of four images were used. One with the PacMan mouth-open, the second with the mouth-closed, while the other two images were the same, but in reverse direction.
